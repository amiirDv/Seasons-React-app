Well it's going to be an application that is going to detect what season the user is currently experiencing

outside like in the real world.

So we're going to say that if the user is located in the northern hemisphere that means we have to actually

detect our users physical location when they visit our application.

So if they're in the northern hemisphere and it's between October and March then it's probably going

to be winter.

So I want to print on the screen something like Bur. it's chilly and shows some snowflake icons.

If the user is in the southern hemisphere so they are visiting our application from any location on

the earth in the southern hemisphere and the month is between March and October.

That means it's winter for them.

People in the southern hemisphere and so I also want to show birr it's chilly.

And then for the obvious reverse cases over here.

So the case in which it is a user is in the northern hemisphere and it's between March and October.

I want to print up something that seems to indicate that it is currently summertime and maybe it's time

to hit the beach or something like that.

So essentially we're just detecting what season it is based on the user's location and their current

time or what month it is.
