This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

Well it's going to be an application that is going to detect what season the user is currently experiencing

outside like in the real world.

So we're going to say that if the user is located in the northern hemisphere that means we have to actually

detect our users physical location when they visit our application.

So if they're in the northern hemisphere and it's between October and March then it's probably going

to be winter.

So I want to print on the screen something like Bur. it's chilly and shows some snowflake icons.

If the user is in the southern hemisphere so they are visiting our application from any location on

the earth in the southern hemisphere and the month is between March and October.

That means it's winter for them.

People in the southern hemisphere and so I also want to show birr it's chilly.

And then for the obvious reverse cases over here.

So the case in which it is a user is in the northern hemisphere and it's between March and October.

I want to print up something that seems to indicate that it is currently summertime and maybe it's time

to hit the beach or something like that.

So essentially we're just detecting what season it is based on the user's location and their current

time or what month it is.
